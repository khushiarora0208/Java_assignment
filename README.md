ASSIGNMENT 1

PART I: INPUTS USING DIFFERENT METHODS

Introduction:

This Java console application showcases different methods for reading user input and calculating factorials. It explores various Java classes and techniques for input handling, providing a practical understanding of basic input/output operations in Java.

Classes Overview:

1)ScannerInput: Utilizes the Scanner class to read an integer from the console and calculate its factorial.

2)ConsoleInput: Demonstrates the Console class for reading user input, including sensitive data like passwords, and calculates factorials.

3)CommandLineInput: Uses command-line arguments to perform factorial calculations.

4)BufferedReaderInput: Implements BufferedReader and InputStreamReader to read text input from the console for factorial calculation.

5)InputStreamInput: Illustrates using InputStream for input handling, with potential corrections for functionality.

6)FactorialCalculator: Contains the logic for calculating the factorial of a number, used across different input methods.

PART II: CALCULATOR

This Java console application allows users to perform various mathematical calculations. It features classes for input collection, calculation, and application flow management.

Classes:

1)Input: Uses Scanner to read two numbers from the user.

2)Calculator: Performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (with zero-division check), square root, power, mean, and variance calculations.

3)Main: Manages the application's flow, displaying a menu, executing calculations, and providing immediate feedback.

The application is designed for ease of use, offering clear prompts and quick results.
