## Rational Number Calculator

### Description
This Java program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations on rational numbers. It accepts input in the form of fractions (a/b) and supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, comparison, conversion to floating-point values, and obtaining absolute values of rational numbers.

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system
- Basic understanding of rational numbers and arithmetic operations

### How to Use
1. Compile the Java files:
   ```
   javac Part_1_2.java RationalNumbers.java
   ```

2. Run the compiled program:
   ```
   java Part_1_2
   ```

3. Follow the prompts to input two rational numbers in the format a/b.
   
4. Choose the operation you want to perform from the provided options.

5. View the result displayed on the console.

### Features
- Addition: Adds two rational numbers and returns the result.
- Subtraction: Subtracts one rational number from another and returns the result.
- Multiplication: Multiplies two rational numbers and returns the result.
- Division: Divides one rational number by another and returns the result.
- Comparison: Compares two rational numbers and determines if they are equal or not.
- Floating Point Value: Converts rational numbers to floating-point values.
- Absolute Value: Computes the absolute value of a rational number.

### Error Handling
- Invalid Input: Handles cases where the input format is incorrect.
- Division by Zero: Prevents division by zero error.
- Input Error: Deals with illegal arguments provided during object instantiation.

### Note
- Ensure that the rational numbers entered are in the format a/b where 'a' and 'b' are integers.
- The program simplifies the rational numbers to their simplest form internally.
