## Factorial Calculator

### Description
This Java program calculates the factorial of integers provided as command-line arguments. It ensures that the input values are within the range of 1 to 15 to prevent overflow or incorrect results. If an input value is outside this range, a custom `FactorialException` is thrown.

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system
- Basic understanding of factorial operation in mathematics

### Features
- Factorial Calculation: Computes the factorial of integers provided as command-line arguments.
- Error Handling: Checks for invalid input formats and throws custom exceptions for values outside the acceptable range.

### Error Handling
- Input Error: Handles cases where the provided argument is not a valid integer.
- Factorial Exception: Throws an exception if the provided integer is outside the range of 1 to 15.

### Note
- Ensure that the provided arguments are valid integers.
- Factorial calculations are limited to integers within the range of 1 to 15 to avoid overflow.
